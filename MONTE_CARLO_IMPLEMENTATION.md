This implementation adds a comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation capability to the Rocket Simulator with realistic wind modeling using wind roses. The enhancement includes seasonal wind patterns, altitude-dependent effects, and statistical analysis of landing zones.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Wind Rose Model (`src/models/wind_rose.py`)

**Test Coverage:**
- Comprehensive unit tests for wind rose functionality
- Test cases for seasonal patterns, altitude effects, and data management
- Integration tests for Monte Carlo simulation

## Technical Implementation Details

### Wind Modeling Physics

1. **Power Law Wind Profile:**
   ```
   V(z) = V_ref * (z/z_ref)^α
   ```
   Where α = 0.2 for open terrain, capturing realistic wind increase with altitude.

2. **Wind Direction Changes:**
   - Backing/veering effects: ~15° direction change with altitude
   - Based on atmospheric boundary layer dynamics

3. **Turbulence Modeling:**
   - Intensity decreases with altitude and increases with lower wind speeds
   - Gust factors scale with mean wind speed and season

4. **Seasonal Patterns:**
   - Realistic frequency distributions for 16 compass directions
   - Season-specific wind speed characteristics
   - Calm condition probabilities

### Monte Carlo Integration

1. **Trajectory Propagation:**
   - Wind effects applied at each time step during simulation
   - 3D wind vector calculation (East-North-Up components)
   - Altitude-dependent wind scaling throughout flight

2. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Elliptical landing zone confidence calculations
   - Wind pattern correlation with landing dispersion
   - Comprehensive reliability metrics

3. **Performance Optimizations:**
   - Efficient random sampling from wind rose distributions
   - Cached atmospheric calculations
   - Vectorized statistical computations

## Demonstration Results

The simple demonstration (`demo_wind_monte_carlo.py`) shows clear seasonal effects:

- **Spring**: Mean landing distance 1,530m (moderate westerly winds)
- **Summer**: Mean landing distance 903m (lighter, more variable winds)  
- **Autumn**: Mean landing distance 1,912m (stronger westerly winds)
- **Winter**: Mean landing distance 2,669m (very strong westerly winds)

These results demonstrate:
- Realistic seasonal wind pattern variations
- Proper scaling of landing dispersion with wind strength
- Consistent directional bias (westerly drift for coastal location)

## Usage Examples

### Basic Wind Rose Usage
```python
from src.models.wind_rose import WindRose, Season

# Create wind rose for specific location
wind_rose = WindRose("Concepcion")

# Get wind condition for current season and altitude
condition = wind_rose.get_wind_condition(Season.SPRING, altitude=500)
print(f"Wind: {condition.speed:.1f} m/s from {condition.direction:.0f}°")
```

### Monte Carlo Simulation
```python
from src.models.monte_carlo import MonteCarloSimulation
from src.models.rocket import Rocket

# Setup simulation
rocket = Rocket(...)  # Initialize with rocket parameters
mc_sim = MonteCarloSimulation(
    rocket=rocket,
    n_sims=200,
    max_altitude=2000,
    location_name="Concepcion",
    season=Season.WINTER
)

# Run simulation
mc_sim.run_simulations()

# Analyze results
results = mc_sim.analyze_results()
print(f"Mean landing distance: {results['basic_statistics']['mean_distance']:.1f} m")
```

### Wind Rose Data Management
```python
# Export wind rose data
wind_rose.export_wind_rose_data("my_location.json")

# Load location-specific data
wind_rose.load_wind_rose_data("data/wind_roses/concepcion_chile.json")
```
